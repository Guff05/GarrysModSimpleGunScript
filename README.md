# GarrysModSimpleGunScript
This is a Simple Mod For a Garrys Mod Gun and includes notes in the script 


To Get this Script to work you need to Put it in Garrys Mod addons Folder Which is in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons

Then you need to create a file and name it whatever you want your gun name to be make sure not to add any spaces then you will add a folder called lua then a folder called weapons then you will put my script in the weapons folder 

it should look like this C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\simple_gun_script\lua\weapons
